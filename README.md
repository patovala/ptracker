ptracker
========

A simple tracker for activities and projects for a small office.

This is the first release of this software, under GPL. It has been built using:

- django v.1.4
- twitter bootstrap
- some snippets from python users.

this is a "still on development" package, and this first release has activities and calendar view ready, maybe there
are still some minor bugs, so please if you use this software I will be glad to be aware of bugs. Also any help on
development is highly appreciated.

TODO
====

Create install instructions, and a crud for proyectos.
