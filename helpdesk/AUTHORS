django-helpdesk was originally written by Ross Poulton. Since publishing the
code a number of people have made some fantastic improvements and provided
bug fixes and updates as the Django codebase has moved on and caused small
portions of this application to break.

To these people, and any more, my sincere thanks:

Andreas Kotowicz
Chris Etcp
David Clymer
