How Does It Look?

Quick Start
-----------

django-helpdesk is just a Django application with models, views, templates, and some media. If you're comfortable with Django just try ``pip install django-helpdesk``. If not, continue to read the Installation document.

Key Features
------------

django-helpdesk has been designed for small businesses who need to recieve, manage and respond to requests for help from customers. In this context *'customers'* may be external users, or other people within your company.

* Tickets can be opened vi a email
* Multiple queues / categories of tickets
* Integrated FAQ / knowledgebase

Customer-facing Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customers (who are not 'staff' users in Django) can:

1. Browse your knowledgebase / FAQ
2. Submit support requests via web/email
3. Review open and closed requests they submitted

Staff Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user is a staff member, they get general helpdesk access, including:

1. See the ticket dashboard showing unassigned tickets and basic status of the helpdesk
2. Review the tickets assigned to them
3. Search through all tickets, open and closed
4. Save their searches for future use
5. Follow up or respond to tickets
6. Assign tickets to themselves or other staff members
7. Resolve tickets
